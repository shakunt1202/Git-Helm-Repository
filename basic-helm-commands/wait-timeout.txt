--wait                         if set, will wait until all Pods, PVCs, Services, and minimum number 
                               of Pods of a Deployment, StatefulSet, or ReplicaSet are in a ready state 
                               before marking the release as successful. 
It will wait for as long as --timeout
by default it will wait for 300sec(5 mins). 
after that installation will fail. 


if we want to specify the time ourselves then,
helm install mywebserver bitnami/apache --wait --timeout 5m10s


helm install mywebserver bitnami/apache --atomic --wait --timeout 5m10s
if atomic flag is specified it will wait for 5 mins and if the installations fails after that 
then it will rollback to the previous sucessful installation.
