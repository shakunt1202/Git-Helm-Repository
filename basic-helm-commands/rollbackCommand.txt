This command rolls back a release to a previous revision.

The first argument of the rollback command is the name of a release, and the second is a revision (version) number. 
If this argument is omitted, it will roll back to the previous release.

To see revision numbers, run 'helm history RELEASE'.
helm rollback <RELEASE> [REVISION] [flags]

eg, helm rollback mywebserver 1


Suppose we uninstall the installation and use the flag --keep-history, we can rollback to the previous revision.
helm uninstall <RELEASE> --keep-history
helm rollback <RELEASE> <version>
